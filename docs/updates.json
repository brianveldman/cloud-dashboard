    "description": "<p>Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC on 29 October 2025, customers and Microsoft services leveraging Azure Front Door (AFD) may have experienced latencies, timeouts, and errors. We have confirmed that an inadvertent configuration change was the trigger event for this issue.</p><p>Affected Azure services may have included, but were not limited to:</p><p>App Service, Azure Active Directory B2C, Azure Communication Services, Azure Databricks, Azure Healthcare APIs, Azure Maps, Azure Portal, Azure SQL Database, Azure Virtual Desktop, Container Registry, Media Services, Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management, Microsoft Entra ID (Mobility Management Policy Service, Identity &amp; Access Management, and User Management UX), Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Sentinel (Threat Intelligence), and Video Indexer.</p><p><strong>Current status:</strong></p><p>We have completed deployment of our ‘last known good’ configuration, and recovery is progressing steadily. We are currently recovering nodes and re-routing traffic through healthy nodes across the global fleet. As recovery continues, some requests may still land on unhealthy nodes, resulting in intermittent failures or reduced availability for a subset of customers.</p><p>This recovery effort involves reloading configurations and rebalancing traffic across a large number of nodes to restore full operational scale. The process is gradual by design, ensuring stability and preventing overload as dependent services recover.</p><p>The AFD service is now operating above 98% availability. While the majority of customers and services are mitigated or seeing strong improvement across affected regions, we are continuing to work on tail-end recovery for remaining impacted customers and services. <strong>We have revised our mitigation time and are currently tracking toward full mitigation by 00:40 UTC on 30 October 2025</strong>, though we will communicate if mitigation is achieved sooner.</p><p>Customer configuration changes remain temporarily blocked to prevent new deployments that could interfere with recovery. We will notify customers once this block has been lifted.</p><p>We will provide another update on our progress within the next 60 minutes, or sooner if warranted.</p>",
